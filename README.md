# Project Info-Task - Lotto Generator with Java

Create a LottoGenerator class with a method generateNumbers, which returns an .
array with 6 random numbers from 1 to 49.
Call the method from your main class and print the result. When running the main method 
multiple times you should see different results.
Bonus: Make sure that the returned array contains unique values (no duplicates) .

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
